STATUS: DRAFTING

Introduction
============

This document outlines the design for multi-threaded TCG emulation.
The original TCG implementation was single threaded and dealt with
multiple CPUs by with simple round-robin scheduling. This simplified a
lot of things but became increasingly limited as systems being
emulated gained additional cores and per-core performance gains for host
systems started to level off.

Memory Consistency
==================

Between emulated guests and host systems there are a range of memory
consistency models. While emulating weakly ordered systems on strongly
ordered hosts shouldn't cause any problems the same is not true for
the reverse setup.

The proposed design currently does not address the problem of
emulating strong ordering on a weakly ordered host although even on
strongly ordered systems software should be using synchronisation
primitives to ensure correct operation.

Memory Barriers
---------------

Barriers (sometimes known as fences) provide a mechanism for software
to enforce a particular ordering of memory operations from the point
of view of external observers (e.g. another processor core). They can
apply to any memory operations as well as just loads or stores.

The Linux kernel has an excellent write-up on the various forms of
memory barrier and the guarantees they can provide [1].

Barriers are often wrapped around synchronisation primitives to
provide explicit memory ordering semantics. However they can be used
by themselves to provide safe lockless access by ensuring for example
a signal flag will always be set after a payload.

DESIGN REQUIREMENT: Add a new tcg_memory_barrier op

This would enforce a strong load/store ordering so all loads/stores
complete at the memory barrier. On single-core non-SMP strongly
ordered backends this could become a NOP.

There may be a case for further refinement if this causes performance
bottlenecks.

Memory Control and Maintenance
------------------------------

This includes a class of instructions for controlling system cache
behaviour. While QEMU doesn't model cache behaviour these instructions
are often seen when code modification has taken place to ensure the
changes take effect.

Synchronisation Primitives
--------------------------

There are two broad types of synchronisation primitives found in
modern ISAs: atomic instructions and exclusive regions.

The first type offer a simple atomic instruction which will guarantee
some sort of test and conditional store will be truly atomic w.r.t.
other cores sharing access to the memory. The classic example is the
x86 cmpxchg instruction.

The second type offer a pair of load/store instructions which offer a
guarantee that an region of memory has not been touched between the
load and store instructions. An example of this is ARM's ldrex/strex
pair where the strex instruction will return a flag indicating a
successful store only if no other CPU has accessed the memory region
since the ldrex.

Traditionally TCG has generated a series of operations that work
because they are within the context of a single translation block so
will have completed before another CPU is scheduled. However with
the ability to have multiple threads running to emulate multiple CPUs
we will need to explicitly expose these semantics.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
 - atomics
   - Introduce some atomic TCG ops for the common semantics
   - The default fallback helper function will use qemu_atomics
   - Each backend can then add a more efficient implementation
 - load/store exclusive
   [AJB:
        There are currently two proposals of interest:
     - Slow-path for atomic instruction translation [2]
     - Helper-based Atomic Instruction Emulation (AIE) [3]
    ]


Shared Data Structures
======================

Global TCG State
----------------

We need to protect the entire code generation cycle including any post
generation patching of the translated code. This also implies a shared
translation buffer which contains code running on all cores. Any
execution path that comes to the main run loop will need to hold a
mutex for code generation. This also includes times when we need flush
code or jumps from the tb_cache.

DESIGN REQUIREMENT: Add locking around all code generation, patching
and jump cache modification

Memory maps and TLBs
--------------------

The memory handling code is fairly critical to the speed of memory
access in the emulated system.

  - Memory regions (dividing up access to PIO, MMIO and RAM)
  - Dirty page tracking (for code gen, migration and display)
  - Virtual TLB (for translating guest address->real address)

There is a both a fast path walked by the generated code and a slow
path when resolution is required. When the TLB tables are updated we
need to ensure they are done in a safe way by bringing all executing
threads to a halt before making the modifications.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

  - TLB Flush will need all other CPUs brought to a halt
  - TLB Update will serialised by way of a mutex
    - the actual update will have to be atomic
    - other threads/CPUs will still run during updates
    - a slow-path fill will need to check for an update after acquiring the mutex


[AJB: is this something where RCU is appropriate?]

Emulated hardware state
-----------------------

Currently the hardware emulation has no protection against
multiple-accesses. However guest systems accessing emulated hardware
should be carrying out their own locking to prevent multiple CPUs
confusing the hardware.

[AJB: should we instrument hardware emulation to detect multiple accesses?]

IO Subsystem
------------

The I/O subsystem is heavily used by KVM and has seen a lot of
improvements to offload I/O tasks to dedicated IOThreads. There should
be no additional locking required once we reach the Block Driver.
